# MINE-OR-ROCK-ML-PREDICTION-PROJECT
Machine Learning Project

In this project I have created a machine learning model using logistic regression algorithm.In this project we have a sonar dataset from which we are going to train and test our model and then evaluate that model to get accuracy score.

Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm.It uses probability to predict the outcome.So our model is going to take input parameters and from that it is going to predict whether the given object is a mine or rock.

This repository consists of :

1) Google Collab Jupyter Notebook => Consists all of the python code for this project.
2) Dataset CSV File.
